# effeta-app

This is a task/reward app made with React Native aimed to parents and kids with intellectual disabilities. Designed to be used by both the parent and the child at the same time. In this app, parents assign tasks for their children and the frequency of the task that the child has to do every week. The child has to complete each daily task by watching every step of the corresponding task. Each step will be shown with an animation for a better understanding for the child. After completing the child completing the task, the parent has to confirm that same task for the child to gain points. These points can be used to redeem rewards, which are created by the parent. The child redeems a reward, and then the parent confirms the same reward to deduct the points.
